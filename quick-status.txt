TT Status - January 9, 2026

WORKING: Root-only Transposition Table

Implementation:
- HASH_INIT computes Zobrist hash from board position at search start
- TT_PROBE only at ply 0 (root) - checks if position cached
- TT_STORE only at ply 0 (root) - caches result after search
- No incremental hash updates in MAKE_MOVE/UNMAKE_MOVE (removed for simplicity)

Test Results:
- Same position, two searches: first ~61s, second instant (TT hit)
- Different positions get different hashes ("D" vs "O")
- Hash is consistent for same position

Limitations:
- TT only caches root positions
- Internal transpositions not detected (would need incremental hash updates)
- This is fine for now - simple and correct

Next Steps (optional optimizations):
- Add incremental hash updates to MAKE_MOVE/UNMAKE_MOVE
- Enable internal TT probe/store (requires correct hash at each node)
- This would detect transpositions during search for additional speedup

Files:
- makemove.asm: Hash update code removed (simplified)
- negamax.asm: Added ply checks for TT_PROBE and TT_STORE
- transposition.asm: TT functions (unchanged, but incremental helpers unused)
